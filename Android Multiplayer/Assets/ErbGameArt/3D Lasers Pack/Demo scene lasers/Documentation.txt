All that is in the folder "3D Lasers pack" can be used in commerce, even demo scene files.
-----------------------------------------------------

Using:

1) Shaders
1.1)The "Use depth" on the material from the custom shaders is responsible for the depths of the material.
1.2)Use "Center glow"[MaterialToggle] only with particle system. This option is used to darken the main texture with a white texture (white is visible, black is invisible).
    If you turn on this feature, you need to use "Custom vertex stream" (Uv0.Custom.xy) in tab "Render". And don't forget to use "Custom data" parameters in your PS.
1.3)This property [HideInInspector]_TilingMainTexUVNoiseZW("Tiling MainTex UV / Noise ZW", Vector) = (1,1,1,1) is need for "EGA_Laser" script! Don't delete it!

2)Scripts
2.1)"EGA_DemoLasers" script is needed to control the rotation of the laser and to change the prefabs.
2.2)"EGA_Laser" can work independently without the help of additional scripts, but the DisablePrepare() function is called using "EGA_DemoLasers" script.
    The MaxLength property is responsible for the length of the laser. Beyond this length, the laser doesn't work.
    The script won't work if you don't select "Hit Effect". "Hit Effect" is a special effect at the end of the laser.
    "Hit Offset" is the shift of the position of the "Hit Effect" over the position of the collision site.
    "MainTextureLength" and "NoiseTextureLength" are responsible for the tiling of the texture.

-----------------------------------------------------
I recomend you to download free Post Processing Stack from Unity Technologies and use post effect "bloom".
Effects on video and screenshots are made using the settings file "CC" (Demo scene folder) for PPS.
